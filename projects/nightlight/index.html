Display waypoints on the map.  Deploy to prod and Done.  The big question I didn’t anticipate is when and how often do you poll for location data?  My user base lives in the same house as me which is great for testing, but bad when your users want to know why their phone batteries are dead in the morning.  There’s definitely a balance and compromises to be made with making location data practical.'},
